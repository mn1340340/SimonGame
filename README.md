# SimonGame
ECE241(Digital Systens) Final Project 

Inspired by the Simon Memory Game 
- press key to begin
- computer will generate a random sequence of lights of increasing difficulty is shown on the DE1-SoC FPGA board and VGA
- A unique audio tone plays when each key is displayed or pressed. 
- replicate the sequence correctly to move on to the next round
- Each round, the sequence length increases, increasing the challenge  
- The LEDs shown between each round indicate whether the user was successful or not  (4 lights -> correct) (all lights -> wrong) 

Programmed in verilog for the DE1-SoC FPGA Board
