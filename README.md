# SimonGame
ECE241(Digital Systens) Final Project 

Programmed in Verilog for the DE1-SoC FPGA Board 

Inspired by the Simon Memory Game 
- Press any key to begin
- The computer will generate a random sequence of lights of increasing difficulty, shown on the DE1-SoC FPGA board and VGA 
- A unique audio tone plays when each key is displayed or pressed
- Replicate the sequence correctly to move on to the next round
- Each round, the sequence length increases, increasing the difficulty  
- The LEDs shown between each round indicate whether the user was successful or not (4 lights -> correct) (all lights -> wrong)
